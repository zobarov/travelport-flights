Your task

Your task is to implement a web service that will connect to an airline service that provides availability results in XML format and convert the results into a different JSON model.
You are being asked to implement the exercise and upload the code for review.

So, you will have to implement a server component that will receive HTTP requests and convert into a REST/XML request to a mock service (see details below) and then convert the results into a JSON response and return to the caller.
